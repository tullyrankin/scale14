# Chef Essentials

This is a repo for developing Chef Essentials.

The latest published version of these training materials are located as follows:

Chef-Essentials-Instructor-Kit, which contains

*	All 15 PPT slide decks, which you should teach from.

* Instructor Guide for you to learn from, practice with, and perhaps use as reference while teaching. (The instructor guide contains speaker notes, instructor notes, and Appendix Z. Appendix Z contains lab setup info.)

* Participant Guide, which is the same as the Instructor Guide sans instructor notes and Appendix Z.

* README.

Here is the link to only the Chef-Essentials-Participant-Guide. (3.7 MB.) This is the link that will be in the student's confirmation email so some students may already have it prior to class starting.

## Workstation Setup

The first series of modules focus on getting learners engaged with the content as quickly as possible. A workstation is provided to the learners.

This workstation is currently being managed as a Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). This AMI is managed by Chef through the Training AWS Account.

* CentOS 6.7 chef-essentials-4.0.0 (ami-11410d74)

> The the AMI was generated with [Packer](https://github.com/chef-training/chefdk-fundamentals-image) and adheres to the following [policy](https://github.com/chef-training/chefdk-fundamentals-image/blob/master/cookbooks/fundamentals/recipes/centos.rb). It is based on a Marketplace AMI so it cannot be made public. If you would like access to this AMI to deliver training please contact [training@chef.io](mailto:training@chef.io) the request that includes your Amazon Account Id.
