# The MySQL Server Ecosystem in 2016

Colin Charles
Audience: Intermediate
Topic: MySQL

MySQL is a unique adult (now 21 years old) in many ways. It supports plugins. It supports storage engines. It is also owned by Oracle, thus birthing two branches of the popular opensource database: Percona Server and MariaDB Server. It also once spawned a fork: Drizzle. Lately a consortium of web scale users (think a chunk of the top 10 sites out there) have spawned WebScaleSQL.

You're a busy DBA having to maintain a mix of this. Or you're a CIO planning to choose one branch. How do you go about picking? Supporting multiple databases? Find out more in this talk. Also covered is a deep-dive into what feature differences exist between MySQL/Percona Server/MariaDB/WebScaleSQL, how distributions package the various databases differently. Within the hour, you'll be informed about the past, the present, and hopefully be knowledgeable enough to know what to pick in the future.

Note, there will also be coverage of the various trees around WebScaleSQL, like the Facebook tree, the Alibaba tree as well as the Twitter tree.
