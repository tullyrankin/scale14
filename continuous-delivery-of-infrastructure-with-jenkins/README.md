# Continuous Delivery of Infrastructure with Jenkins

**Presenter:**RTyler Croy<br />
**Audience:** Intermediate<br />
**Topic:** Developer

How long does it take to deploy a configuration change to production? Ten minutes? An hour? A day? Weeks!? For many years developers have been moving towards “continuous delivery” models for their, primarily web-based, applications. There are numerous benefits to be reaped by increasing discipline and automation by regularly deploying software, but many of these practices have not seen rapid adoption by Operations and Infrastructure teams.

In this talk we will review continuous delivery concepts and put them into practice by building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins to test, stage and deploy to infrastructure code to production. Reducing the effort, error rate and time it takes to deploy a configuration to change to production means less time fighting fires and more time doing what you want.
