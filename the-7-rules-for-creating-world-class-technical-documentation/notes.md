- Before you start, be clear about what you want the reader to do after you end
- Write to an outline, always
- clarity = illustrations + words
- Watch the pronouns
- Embrace revision

Keep the Reader Entertained

- Use Graphics
- Use examples generously
- Use analogies when possible

    - Tell 'em what you going to tell 'em
    - Tell 'em
    - Tell 'em what you told them


Write an Outline, Always

- Use the basic rules of outlining
- In case you were sleeping in 8th Grade:
    - You must have at least 2 sub levels to a level.
    - You must have at least 2 sentences in every level.
- **The 2 Sentence Rule is very, very, very important!!!**

Clarity = illustrations + words

- Illustrations describe the feeling. Words describe the context.
- Add captions to illustrations!
- 1 Concept = 1 illustration
- The readers attention is usually drawn to the illustration first
- Reference your captions in the copy

Creating Context

- Pictures translate feelings not context

Watch the pronounds

- it
- this
- that
- these
- those
- they

Embrace Revision

- As technology releases increase, revision cycles must become shorter

Video

- 1 minute = $1000
- 1 word = 1 second
- 5 minutes max, unless you have extraordinary production quality
